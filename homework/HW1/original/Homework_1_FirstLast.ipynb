    "\n",
    "### Due: TBD\n",
    "\n",
    "### Directions: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Change the name of your notebook to Homework1_FirstLast.ipynb, where First is your first name and Last is your last name.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each of the following prompts, write or modify Python code that fulfills the requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important information to remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Periodically, you should click File -> Save Notebook\n",
    "2. When you are done working for the day, click File -> Log Out\n",
    "3. When you are finished, download the notebook and upload it to the submission link\n",

    "# Extra requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks:\n",
    "1. Set your constants (3 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad e_0 = 0.611 \\, kPa$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad \\frac{L}{R_v} = 5423 \\, K$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad T_0 = 273 \\, K$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set your temperature and dewpoint in Fahrenheit (F) (2 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Convert your temperature and dewpoint in F to Kelvin (K) (5 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "$K = (F + 459.67) \\times \\frac{5}{9}$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Calculate relative humidity based on the following equation using the constants, temperature, and dewpoint (5 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "$e_s = e_0 \\cdot e^{\\frac{L}{R_v} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_0} - \\frac{1}{T \\, \\text{or} \\, T_d} \\right)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Format your printed answers as follows (5 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "T = 33 Td = 20 and your answer is 58.45 %\n",
    "T = 40 Td = 40 and your answer is 100.00 %\n",

    "1. The measured partial pressure of water vapor in the atmosphere (vapor pressure)\n",
    "2. The \"maxmimum\" partial pressure of water vapor (saturation vapor pressure).\n",

    "Saturation vapor pressure is sometimes simplified as the \"capacity\" of the air to hold water vapor, and it is directly related to temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vapor pressure is the actual amount of water vapor in the air, and it is directly related to the dew point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative humidity is ratio of actual to maximum water vapor in the air, and is communicated as \"percent of capacity\". In reality, it is more complex than that, but it will be fine to think of it that way for our purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can compare it to your grade in the course:\n",
    "\n",
    "Total possible points = saturation vapor pressure\n",
    "\n",
    "points earned = vapor pressure\n",
    "\n",
    "Grade in the course = 100 x (points earned / total possible points)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Exponents with math.exp()\n",
    "\n",
